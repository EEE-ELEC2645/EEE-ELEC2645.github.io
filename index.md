# Welcome to ELEC2645 - Embedded Systems Project

This is the reference website for the lab work during the ELEC2645 module. It covers the basics of `C` programming and the concepts we will use throughout the course. Use the *Search* function at the top of the page to find the parts relevant to the program you are currently writing.

The page will be updated as we go through to the course so as to not be too overwhelming!

## C Programming

- Data Types
- Conditionals
- For Loops
- While Loops
- Arrays
- Strings
- Enums




## Cheatsheets - Covering the basics

- Markdown, for writing readmes and documentation
- GitHub Codespaces
- Git and Version Control


## Further Reading

All the material needed for assessment will be described on this site, but no one resource can teach you all of `C` or how best to use it in all situations. The following are other places you can look that I have gone through myself

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/c/index.php) - covers the basics well and you can run the code online, but the explanations can be a bit limited
- [learn-c](https://www.learn-c.org/) - has short exercises after each topic which I like, some it is not so relevant for Embedded
- [tutorials point C standard library](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/index.htm) - Has detailed examples for each function. Note their online C compiler has problems with using `math.h`, their [general C course](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm) I personally find a bit too wordy and some of the explanations are a bit confusing
