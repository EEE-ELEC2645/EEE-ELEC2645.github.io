# Welcome to ELEC2645 - Embedded Systems Project

This is the reference website for the lab work during the ELEC2645 module. It covers the basics of `C` programming and the concepts we will use throughout the course.

The page will be updated as we go through to the course 

## C Programming

- Data Types
- Conditionals
- For Loops
- While Loops
- Arrays
- Strings
- Enums




## Cheatsheets - Covering the basics

- Markdown, for writing readmes and documentation
- Git and Version Control



## Further Reading

All the material needed for assessment will be described on this site, but no one resource can teach you all of `C` or how best to use it in all situations. The following are other places you can look that I have gone through myself

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/c/index.php) - covers the basics well and you can run the code online
- [learn-c](https://www.learn-c.org/) - has short exercises after each topic which I like
