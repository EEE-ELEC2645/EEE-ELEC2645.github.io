# GitHub Codespaces


## Brief Explanation of the files in each activity

Each Unit 1 activity has files stored in a GitHub repository for example [Unit 1.6](https://github.com/ELEC2645/1_6_Debug)


```
.devcontainer
.gitignore
LICENSE
Makefile
README.md
main.c   <----- This is the most important file
test.sh
```

---

## Most important `.c` files

The code which you need to edit are found in the `.c` files 


## Setup or Supporting files

- `.devcontainer` - Configuration for the development environment in GitHub Codespaces (e.g. extensions).
- `.gitignore` -  Specifies files and folders for Git to ignore (not track in version control).
- `LICENSE` - Contains the legal terms under which the project code can be used, modified, and shared.
- `Makefile` - Automates build tasks (e.g., compiling code) using the `make` command.
- `README.md` - Project overview, instructions, and documentation for users. Written in Markdown (See guide)
- `test.sh` - Shell script for running automated tests or checks on the code.
